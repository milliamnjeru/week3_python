week 3 assignment on python basic.
# strings and file handling
## Exercises
1. Write a program that takes a sentence and then prints the number of words in that sentence.

2. Create a program that checks if two given strings are anagrams of each other.
   
3.Write a program that takes a string as input from the user and checks if it’s a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward). Ignore case sensitivity and punctuation.

4.write a program that opens an existing text file, reads its contents, and creates a new file with a different name, writing the copied content to the new file.

5.Write a program that opens a text file and iterates through each line using a for loop, printing each line separately.

# lists and tuple
## Exercises
1. Write a program that creates a list of numbers or words and then sorts the list in ascending or descending order using built-in functions like sorted or the sort method.

2.Write a Python program to get the largest number from the following list: l1 = [43, 89, 67, 56, 12]

3.Write a Python program to sum all the items in this list: list1 = [10,20,30,40,50]

4.Write a Python program to remove duplicates from the following list: list2 = [23, 45, 67, -10, 23, 50, -10]

5.Write a program that creates a list of numbers and then iterates through the list using a for loop, printing each element and its index.

6.Create a tuple to store a student’s name, age, and grade. Print the entire tuple.

7.Create a tuple to store mathematical operators (+, -, *, /) and write a program that allows users to choose an operator and perform basic calculations with two numbers.

# dictionaries and sets 
## Exercises
1.Write a Python program to sum up all the items in a dictionary.

2.Create a dictionary to store product information (name, price, quantity). Allow users to add, update, and remove items from the inventory.

3.Create a dictionary where keys are departments in a company and values are nested dictionaries containing employee information (name, role).

4.Write a function to create a new set that contains the identical items from two given sets.

5.Return the identical elements in the two given sets.
 -For inputs with sets {1, 2, 3, 4} and {3, 4, 5, 6}, the return value should be either {3, 4} or {4, 3}.

# regex expressions
## Exercises
1.Write a Python program to check that a string contains only a certain set of characters (in this case a-z, A-Z and 0-9).

2.Write a Python program that matches a string that has an ‘a’ followed by anything, ending in ‘b’.

3.Write a program that uses regex to validate user input. Examples:

4.Check if a password meets certain criteria (e.g., minimum length, containing uppercase and lowercase letters).
  -Validate a date format (e.g., DD/MM/YYYY).
  
5.Write a program that uses regex to extract specific information from a string. Examples:

6.Extract email addresses: Find all strings containing “@” and a dot (.).

7.Extract phone numbers: Find all strings with a specific format (e.g., XXX-XXX-XXXX).

8.Write a program that uses regex to search for and replace text in a string. Example:
 -Replace all occurrences of “Mr.” with “Ms.”: text.replace(r”Mr.”, “Ms.”) (r prefix for raw string)
